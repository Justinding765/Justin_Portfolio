                        The Mock Command Terminal replicates the typical features of a command terminal through CURL commands 
                        including downloading files from a URL as well as creating, deleting, 
                        modifying files and directories, and numerous additional features that are found in a standard command terminal<br/> <br/>
                        The user can create their own Mock Command Terminal through an IDE such as Visual Studio 
                        and construct and navigate through their own Mock File System</p>
